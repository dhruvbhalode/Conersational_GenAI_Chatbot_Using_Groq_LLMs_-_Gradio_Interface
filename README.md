# Groq-based-LLaMA3-8B-Chatbot-For-GenAI-Tasks

## Title: 
Conversational AI Chatbot using Groq LLMs and Gradio Interface.

## Domain:
Generative AI | NLP | Chatbot | Human – Computer interaction.

## Problem Statement:
In today's digital world, interactive chatbots are essential for automating customer support, education, and personal help. 
However, many AI-powered solutions are either expensive, need complicated infrastructure, or rely on restricted free-tier APIs such as OpenAI's. 
There is a need for a conversational AI that is responsive, cost-effective, and accessible, can handle a wide range of user inputs, and is simple to implement. 
This project uses the Groq LLM API and Gradio to create a lightweight, quick chatbot with a nice user interface.

## Proposed Solution:
This project suggests creating a responsive chatbot that employs Groq's LLM (such as LLaMA 3 or Mixtral) via API to create human-like replies. 
A Python backend is used to handle user input and get AI-generated responses, while Gradio offers a user-friendly web frontend. 
The system can handle all forms of user-entered inputs, including informal discussions, queries, and edge situations, with dependable fallback replies. 
The chatbot may be implemented locally or hosted conveniently online.

## Objectives:
•	To build a chatbot that responds intelligently to user inputs.
•	To utilize Groq’s fast and efficient language models for inference.
•	To provide a simple and interactive frontend using Gradio.
•	To handle various types of inputs, including blank, informal, and complex queries.
•	To ensure low latency and high-quality responses using serverless AI.

## Expected Outcome:
A functional AI chatbot software that:
•	Communicates naturally and responds to a variety of inquiries.
•	Is quick and responsive because to Groq's inference engine.
•	Gradio provides a beautiful and engaging online interface.
•	Memory, personality, and domain-specific knowledge are all possible extensions.

## Tools Required:
•	Python (Primary Programming Language) 
•	Transformers library: Groq
•	Pre-trained LLMs: LLaMA 3 8B
•	Gradio for web interface
•	Google Colab / T4 GPU
